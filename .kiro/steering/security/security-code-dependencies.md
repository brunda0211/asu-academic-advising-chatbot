# Security: Code & Dependencies

Code security, dependency management, and AI/GenAI security best practices for CIC projects.

## 4. Code Security and Dependency Management

| Practice | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pin dependencies** | Always pin exact versions in `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`. |
| **Scan dependencies** | Run `pip-audit` (Python) and `npm audit` (TypeScript) in CI. |
| **Update regularly** | Use Dependabot or a manual review cadence (at least monthly). |
| **Run SAST** | Run Bandit (Python) and ESLint-security (TypeScript) on every commit. |
| **Fix or document** | Every HIGH/CRITICAL finding must be fixed or have a documented risk acceptance with a rationale and owner. |
| **Secure temp files** | Use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` with `delete=True`. Call `.flush()` before reading `.name`. Never construct temp paths with user input. |
| **Validate paths** | Never concatenate user input into file paths. Use `os.path.basename()` and validate against an allowlist. |
| **No `eval()` or `exec()`** | Never use dynamic code execution on untrusted input. |

## 5. AI and GenAI Security

| Practice | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Validate AI inputs** | Sanitize all content before sending it to a model. Limit input size and character set. |
| **Filter AI outputs** | Never insert model output directly into HTML, SQL, or code. Sanitize and validate against expected structure. |
| **Protect against prompt injection** | Separate system prompts from user content. Use delimiters and instruct the model to ignore conflicting instructions in user content. |
| **Log all invocations** | Log the model ID, input hash (not full PII), output hash, latency, and token count for every Bedrock call. |
| **Document model usage** | Maintain a register of which models are used, their purpose, and who approved their use. |
| **Consider bias** | For accessibility features, document how AI-generated content is reviewed for accuracy and bias. Even in a PoC, note this as a known risk. |
| **Scope Bedrock permissions** | Grant `bedrock:InvokeModel` only for the specific model ARNs used, not `bedrock:*`. |

### Example: Safe AI Output Handling

```python
import html

def sanitize_ai_output(ai_text: str, max_length: int = 500) -> str:
    # Never insert model output directly into HTML, SQL, or code
    safe_text = html.escape(ai_text.strip())
    return safe_text[:max_length]
```
